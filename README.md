# Bacterial-Transmission-Elucidation

• Utilized BFS, divide-and-conquer, and greedy algorithms to develop an algorithm for calculating Rooted Directed Minimum
Spanning Trees (RDMST) in graphs, analyzing an outbreak of Klebsiella pneumoniae
• Conducted data analysis on 18 patient cases and applied Hamming distance calculations to construct a weighted digraph
• Devised and implemented Python functions for edge weight modification and RDST candidate computation, leveraging
mathematical models to build a transmission map and elucidate bacterial transmission pathways
